# Intrusion Detection System using CICIDS2017 Dataset

## 📌 Overview
This project implements an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** using the **CICIDS2017** dataset to detect and classify malicious network activities.  
It applies **data preprocessing**, **dimensionality reduction**, and **machine learning classification models** to identify both binary (Normal vs. Attack) and multi-class attack categories.

The system is built with **Python**, leverages **scikit-learn** for ML models, and applies techniques like **SMOTE** for class imbalance handling and **Incremental PCA** for feature reduction.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is **CICIDS2017**, which contains realistic network traffic data for various attack types such as DoS, DDoS, Brute Force, Botnet, Port Scans, and more.

## ⚙ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/piyushsharma0211/Intrusion_detection.git
cd Intrusion_detection
````

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Download Dataset

Download the dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MmaRbhLKoBKLFmlC5HVRysUuhvGB7jiC?usp=sharing) and place it inside the `data/` folder.

### 4️⃣ Run the IDS

```bash
python main.py
```

## 📊 Results (Example)

| Model               | Accuracy | Recall | F1-score |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------ | -------- |
| Logistic Regression | 97.3%    | 96.8%  | 97.0%    |
| SVM                 | 98.1%    | 97.5%  | 97.8%    |
| Random Forest       | 99.2%    | 99.0%  | 99.1%    |

*(Values are based on our trained models; your results may vary.)*

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Add **deep learning** models (LSTM, CNN) for better accuracy
* Deploy the IDS as a **real-time network monitoring tool**
* Integrate with **cloud services** for large-scale data handling

## **What You Should Upload to GitHub**
You should avoid uploading large raw datasets directly to GitHub — instead, provide the link. Here's what to upload:

### **1. Project Code**
- `main.py` → Script to run the IDS pipeline
- `scripts/` → Python scripts for modular tasks (preprocessing, training, evaluation)
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step work (optional, but useful)
- `requirements.txt` → List of dependencies

### **2. Model & Results**
- `models/` → Pre-trained models (`.pkl` files) if they’re not too large
- `results/` → Confusion matrices, plots, metrics reports

### **3. Documentation**
- `README.md` → The file I gave above
- Any `.pdf` report or presentation (optional)

### **4. Ignore Unnecessary Files**
Create a `.gitignore` file to avoid:
```

**pycache**/
\*.csv
\*.xlsx
data/
.DS\_Store
\*.ipynb\_checkpoints

```
